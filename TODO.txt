- mutable equation for Sandwiches screen

LOW
- dev features for game (skip, play all, ...)
- French curves for brackets

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- IntegerSpinner (generalize to NumberSpinner with options.decimalPlaces)
- IntegerNode (generalize to NumberNode with options.decimalPlaces)
- HBracketNode

MISC
- watch for https://phet.unfuddle.com/a#/projects/9404/tickets/by_number/3524
- fix name of Reaction_2N2_O2__2NO2, it should be Reaction_2N2_O2__2N2O
