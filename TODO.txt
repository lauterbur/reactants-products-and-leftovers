- implement RPALRewardNode, add to ResultsNode

MEDIUM
- why is spacing different between 2 slices of cheese (or meat) comparing RHS of equation and 'products'
- random layout strategy for molecules in boxes
- dev features for game (skip, play all, ...)

LOW

- curves for brackets
- add title-bar feature to sun.AccordionBox, sun#135

MIGRATE TO COMMON

GAME FRAMEWORK
- GameModel, GamePhase, GamePhaseProperty, PlayState, PlayNode, ResultsNode are all almost identical to
  graphing-lines, is there a framework here?
