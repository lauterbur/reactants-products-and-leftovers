TODO list for reactants-products-and-leftovers

HIGH
- promote Leftover to a first-class Substance subtype, instead of a Reactant property? (No, leftovers don't have a coefficient)
- ChallengeNode constructor is passed both model and challenge params, the latter is redundant
- get rid of (or minimize) use of BoxItem to improve: BeforeAfterNode, ChallengeNode, StacksAccordionBox, RandomBox, QuantitiesNode

MEDIUM
- #5 code review
- #6 screenshot
- #7 remove 'equation' query parameter, decide on optimal placement of equation
- #8 remove 'coefficients' query parameter, decide whether to use spinners or pickers
- #9 location of 'Reset All' button

LOW

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- HBracketNode
- NumberSpinner
- NumberNode
- BeforeProperty (or add an option to Property?)

MISC
- watch for https://phet.unfuddle.com/a#/projects/9404/tickets/by_number/3524 (correct answer treated as wrong)
