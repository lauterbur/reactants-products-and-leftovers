# 1.0.0-dev.2 9/2/14
9/2/14 set left and top of ReactionBoxesNode, so that it doesn't jump around when switching reactions
9/2/14 reduce width of boxes so that 'reactants' bracket doesn't interfere with 'Reset All' button for custom sandwich
9/2/14 fix computation of maxImageHeight in ReactionBoxesNode, so that y-margin is correct
9/2/14 create placeholder for custom sandwich, to evaluate worst-case layout
9/2/14 reduce size of sandwich components
9/2/14 add stroke around content inside accordion boxes
8/29/14 implement MoleculeFactory.createSandwichNode
